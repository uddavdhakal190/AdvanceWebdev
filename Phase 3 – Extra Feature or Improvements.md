### **Phase 3 – Extra Feature or Improvements** 

#### **Chosen Use Case/Feature to Improve:**
**API Endpoint Structure and Proxy Configuration**  
This improvement was chosen because it is a critical aspect of the application's functionality that affects all user interactions. Proper API structure and communication patterns ensure seamless integration between the frontend and backend services.

---

### **🔍 Original Definition**
From Phase 1, the application required:
- User authentication (login/register)
- Transaction management (CRUD operations)
- Real-time data updates
- Secure API communication

---

### **🔄 Implementation**

#### **Technical Changes Required:**
1. Updated all API endpoints to follow a consistent structure with the `/api/v1` prefix.
2. Modified the proxy configuration in the client application to ensure proper communication with the backend.
3. Restructured server-side route handling for better organization.
4. Added proper error handling for API requests to improve debugging and user experience.

#### **Technologies and Methods Used:**
- **Express.js**: For managing API routes on the server.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests from the client.
- **React Router**: For client-side routing and navigation.
- **Environment Variables**: For managing configuration securely.
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration.

#### **Specific Changes Made:**
- Added `/api/v1` prefix to all API endpoints for consistency and future-proofing.
- Updated the `proxy` field in package.json to point to the correct backend base URL.
- Restructured server-side routes into modular files for better maintainability.
- Implemented centralized error handling middleware in the backend.

### **⚙️ Challenges Encountered and Solutions**

1. **Challenge 1: 404 Errors on API Requests**
   - **Problem:** API requests were failing with 404 errors due to mismatched endpoint paths.
   - **Solution:** Updated all endpoints to include the `/api/v1` prefix to match the server routes.

2. **Challenge 2: Proxy Configuration Issues**
   - **Problem:** The client application couldn't properly communicate with the backend.
   - **Solution:** Updated the `proxy` configuration in package.json to point to the correct backend base URL.

3. **Challenge 3: Port Conflicts**
   - **Problem:** The development server couldn't start due to port conflicts.
   - **Solution:** Implemented proper process management and dynamic port handling using environment variables.

---

### **✅ Benefits of the Improvement**
- **Consistency:** A more consistent and maintainable API structure.
- **Error Handling:** Improved debugging capabilities through centralized error handling.
- **Security:** Enhanced security through proper route organization.
- **Scalability:** A scalable API structure that supports future additions.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Better separation between frontend and backend responsibilities.

### **📂 Code Structure Improvements**
1. **Server-Side Routes:**
   - Restructured into modular files (e.g., `authRoutes.js`, `transactionRoutes.js`) for better organization.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     // filepath: /server/routes/authRoutes.js
     const express = require('express');
     const router = express.Router();

     // Define routes
     router.post('/api/v1/login', loginController);
     router.post('/api/v1/register', registerController);

     module.exports = router;
     ```

2. **Proxy Configuration:**
   - Updated package.json:
     ```json
     // filepath: /client/package.json
     "proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
     ```

3. **Centralized Error Handling:**
   - Example middleware:
     ```javascript
     // filepath: /server/middleware/errorHandler.js
     const errorHandler = (err, req, res, next) => {
         console.error(err.stack);
         res.status(err.status || 500).json({ error: err.message });
     };

     module.exports = errorHandler;
     ```

---

### **🧪 Testing and Verification**
- Verified all API endpoints are working correctly using Postman.
- Tested the user authentication flow (login/register).
- Confirmed transaction operations (CRUD) are functioning as expected.
- Validated error handling by simulating various failure scenarios.

---

### **🚀 Future Considerations**
1. Implement an API versioning strategy to support backward compatibility.
2. Add request/response logging for better monitoring and debugging.
3. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of API endpoints.
4. Add API documentation using tools like Swagger or Postman.
5. Consider implementing API caching for improved performance.

---

### **Summary**
This improvement phase focused on making the application more robust and maintainable by implementing a proper API structure
and communication patterns. The changes ensure that the application follows best practices for API design and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.
