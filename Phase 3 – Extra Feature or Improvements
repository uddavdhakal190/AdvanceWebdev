Phase 3 ‚Äì Extra Feature or Improvements 
Chosen Use Case/Feature to Improve: API Endpoint Structure and Proxy Configuration
I improved the API endpoint structure and proxy configuration to ensure proper communication between the frontend and backend services. This was chosen because it's a critical aspect of the application's functionality that affects all user interactions.
üîç Original Definition
From Phase 1, the application required:
User authentication (login/register)
Transaction management (CRUD operations)
Real-time data updates
Secure API communication
üîÑ Implementation
Technical Changes Required:
Updated all API endpoints to follow a consistent structure with /api/v1 prefix
Modified the proxy configuration in the client application
Restructured server-side route handling
Added proper error handling for API requests
Technologies and Methods Used:
Express.js for API route management
Axios for HTTP requests
React Router for client-side routing
Environment variables for configuration
Git for version control
Specific Changes Made:
Apply
)
Challenges Encountered and Solutions:
Challenge 1: 404 Errors on API Requests
Problem: API requests were failing with 404 errors
Solution: Updated all endpoints to include the /api/v1 prefix to match server routes
Challenge 2: Proxy Configuration Issues
Problem: Client couldn't properly communicate with the backend
Solution: Updated the proxy configuration in client/package.json to point to the correct base URL
Challenge 3: Port Conflicts
Problem: Development server couldn't start due to port conflicts
Solution: Implemented proper process management and port handling
Benefits of the Improvement:
More consistent and maintainable API structure
Better error handling and debugging capabilities
Improved security through proper route organization
Enhanced scalability for future API additions
Better separation of concerns between frontend and backend
Code Structure Improvements:
Apply
;
Testing and Verification:
Verified all API endpoints are working correctly
Tested user authentication flow
Confirmed transaction operations are functioning
Validated error handling
Future Considerations:
Implement API versioning strategy
Add request/response logging
Implement rate limiting
Add API documentation
Consider implementing API caching
This improvement phase focused on making the application more robust and maintainable by implementing proper API structure and communication patterns. The changes ensure that the application follows best practices for API design and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.
