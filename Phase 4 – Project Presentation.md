 üìù Project Overview
 
Expense Tracker is a web application designed to help users manage their personal finances effectively. The application allows users to track their income and expenses, view transaction history, and manage their financial records in a user-friendly interface.

Target Users:

Individuals looking to track personal expenses
People who want to manage their daily financial transactions
Users who need a simple, intuitive way to monitor their spending habits

Context:
The application was developed as part of the Advanced Web Development course, demonstrating the implementation of a full-stack MERN application with modern web development practices.
