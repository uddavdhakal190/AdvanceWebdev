 üìù Project Overview
 
Expense Tracker is a web application designed to help users manage their personal finances effectively. The application allows users to track their income and expenses, view transaction history, and manage their financial records in a user-friendly interface.

Target Users:

Individuals looking to track personal expenses
People who want to manage their daily financial transactions
Users who need a simple, intuitive way to monitor their spending habits

Context:
The application was developed as part of the Advanced Web Development course, demonstrating the implementation of a full-stack MERN application with modern web development practices.

‚úçÔ∏è Technical Implementation

Technologies Used:

Frontend:

React.js for UI components
Redux for state management
Ant Design for UI components
Axios for API calls

Backend:

Node.js & Express.js
MongoDB with Mongoose
JWT for authentication
bcryptjs for password hashing

Development Tools:

Git for version control 
npm for package management 
Render for deployment 

üöÇ Development Process

Phase 1: Planning and Setup

Defined project requirements
Set up development environment
Created initial project structure

Phase 2: Core Development

Implemented user authentication
Created transaction management system
Developed UI components

Phase 3: Testing and Deployment

Fixed CORS issues
Implemented error handling
Deployed to Render

Key Decisions

Architecture:
Chose MERN stack for full-stack development
Implemented Redux for state management
Used Ant Design for consistent UI

Security:
Implemented JWT authentication
Added password hashing
Configured CORS properly

‚òÄÔ∏è Reflection and Future Work

What Worked Well:

User Interface:
Clean and intuitive design
Responsive layout
Smooth user experience

Technical Implementation:
Secure authentication
Efficient data management
Good error handling

Challenges Faced:

CORS Configuration:
Initially had issues with cross-origin requests
Resolved by proper CORS setup and axios configuration

Deployment:
Faced path-to-regexp error
Solved by updating dependencies and configuration

Future Improvements:

Features to Add:
Data visualization (charts and graphs)
Export functionality (PDF/Excel)
Budget planning tools
Category management
Multi-currency support

Technical Improvements:
Add unit tests
Implement real-time updates
Add offline support
Improve performance optimization
Add more security features

User Experience:
Add dark mode
Implement more filtering options
Add search functionality
Improve mobile responsiveness

This project successfully demonstrates the implementation of a full-stack web application with modern technologies and best practices. The experience gained in handling authentication, data management, and deployment will be valuable for future projects.
